group 25 - arduino code 

To run the arduino sensor code, users will have to download the SparkFun library from the following link to run the code:
https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RHT03_Arduino_Library/releases/tag/V_1.0.0 

The sensor_code file is the file that group 25 used for our implementation of the ForMary project.
The example_code file is the file that contains all the sensors that were intended to be used in the project.
